# FM4SE Lab

A collaborative repository for experiments and research on Foundation Models for Software Engineering.

## About

The goal is to build the fundamental building blocks for leveraging foundation models to be better at software engineering tasks. This includes creating datasets, benchmarks, and tools to evaluate and improve the performance of foundation models in various software engineering applications.

## Structure

- `experiments/`: Each subdirectory contains code and data for specific experiments.
- `shared/`: Common utilities and scripts used across multiple experiments.
